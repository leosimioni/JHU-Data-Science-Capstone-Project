# Capstone Project

Data Science Specialization

Johns Hopkins University

Leonardo Simioni

## Overview
This capstone project started with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It covered cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, the knowledge I gained in the process was used to build a predictive text product.

This application was developed as part of the Capstone Project for the Data Science Specialization of Johns Hopkins University. The dataset used was provided in collaboration with SwifKey.

The following steps culminated in the development of this app:

-Getting and cleaning the data

-Exploratory Data Analysis

-Data Modeling

-Algorithm Implementation

-Improving predictive accuracy, computational runtine and model complexity

-Creating the Data Product (Word Prediction App)
